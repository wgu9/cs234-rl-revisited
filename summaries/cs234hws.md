## 🎯 Why Each Assignment Matters

### Assignment 1: The Foundation 🏗️
```mermaid
pie title "Skills from Assignment 1"

    "Dynamic Programming" : 25
    "Policy Evaluation" : 20
    "Horizon Analysis" : 15
    "Reward Design Basics" : 10
```

**Key Insight**: Without understanding basic MDPs, you cannot appreciate why deep RL is necessary or when simpler methods suffice.

### Assignment 2: The Scale-Up 📈
```mermaid

        CNN[Conv Networks]
    end
    
    D --> ER
    D --> TN
    D --> CNN
```

**Key Insight**: DQN's innovations (replay buffer, target network) solve fundamental instabilities in neural network training for RL.
