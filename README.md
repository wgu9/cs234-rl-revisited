# Reinforcement Learning: CS234 Revisited

This repository is a structured, modern re-implementation and reflection of key concepts from Stanford's CS234: Reinforcement Learning.

> 🎯 **Goal**: To revisit, internalize, and document foundational RL concepts for personal mastery — and to share practical, annotated resources with peers who are also learning or teaching RL.

This project includes:
- 📘 Cleanly rewritten homework code and solutions (where permitted)
- 🧠 Deep conceptual summaries in markdown and Jupyter Notebook formats
- 🔁 Refactored implementations with modular structure and reproducibility
- 📊 Visualizations and experiment logs for each algorithm
- 🧩 Optional links to PyTorch, CleanRL, or real-world extensions

Inspired by my experience in CS234/XCS234 and motivated by the long-term importance of RL for building agents and decision-making systems, this repo serves as a learning hub for myself and others.
